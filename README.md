# rootless-scan
RootlessNetScan is a modern, lightweight, and advanced network scanning tool built in Python that works entirely without root access. Unlike traditional scanners that require privileged raw sockets, RootlessNetScan uses asynchronous TCP connect scans to deliver fast, reliable, and rootless scanning on any system â€” Linux, macOS, or Windows.
